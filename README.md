# Investment-AI

## Description

This project aims to decide stock sentiment based on news rather than statistical analysis. We are testing to see if news data alone is powerful enough to trade on. One of the biggest shortcomings that most stock screeners or stock analysis applications have is a lack of transparency. They do not tell you why a stock has a 78% chance of increasing in value. Our application will help the end-user understand how and why we came to the analysis we did and what influenced our decision.
